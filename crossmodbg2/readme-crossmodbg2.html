<h2>Overview</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p> This mod will add new material for between various Baldur's Gate II mods including banters, romance conflicts and interjections. </p> 
</div> 
<h2> Compatibility </h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p> This mod is designed to work with Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn with or without the Throne of Bhaal expansion pack. Please install this after all other <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> mods. </p> 
</div> 
<h2> Installation </h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p> <strong>Windows</strong><br /> 
    Crossmod Banter Pack is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> and
    is distributed as a self-extracting archive. To install, simply double-click
    the archive and follow the instructions on screen. </p> 
  <p> Alternatively the files can be extracted from the archive using <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/">WinRAR</a>.
    If properly extracted, you should have a <strong>crossmodbg2</strong> folder and <strong>setup-crossmodbg2.exe</strong>
    in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder. To install,
    simply double-click setup-crossmodbg2.exe and follow the instructions on
    screen. </p> 
  <p> Please run setup-crossmodbg2.exe in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder
    to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Mac OS X</strong><br /> 
    <em>If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before extracting the
    new version. Please note that this mod is incompatible with Mod Organizer.</em> Crossmod
    Banter Pack is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>.
    To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder. If
    properly extracted, you should have a crossmodbg2 folder, setup-crossmodbg2,
    and setup-crossmodbg2.command in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder.
    To install, simply double-click <strong>setup-crossmodbg2.command</strong> and
    follow the instructions on screen. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Linux</strong><br />
Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify. Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/~thebigg "><acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal and cd to your BG2 installation directory, run 'tolower' and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lower cased file name. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.<br />
Run <strong>WeInstall crossmodbg2</strong> in your game folder to install the mod. Then run <strong>wine BGMain.exe</strong> and start playing.</p>

  <p> <strong>Note: Crossmod Banter Pack </strong><br /> 
    This component will add new material to your install if two or more of the mods covered by the project are installed. It will not be able to see into the future and detect something not insstalled before it looks at your installation - please place it <strong> last in install order after all of the mods in this list</strong>. </p>
